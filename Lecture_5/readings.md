# Diagnosis at a Distance: The Invisible Work of Patients and Healthcare Professionals in Cardiac Telemonitoring Technology (Nelly Oudshoorn, 2008)

## Abstract

Telemonitoring redefines patients as active “diagnostic agents.”

Focus: ambulatory ECG recorder for irregular heart rhythms.

Shows how invisible work by nurses and physicians enables patients to integrate technology into daily life and become responsible participants

## Introduction

Telemedicine often portrayed as cost- and labor-saving.

**Reality**: work is redistributed, not reduced.

Technologies shift responsibilities across patients, nurses, physicians, and machines, creating a new “geography of responsibilities”

## Methods

Empirical study (2004–2005, Netherlands).

Data: 95 patients using ECG recorders; 11 patient interviews, 54 questionnaires, 2 general practitioners, home-care offices, and telemedical centre staff.

Observations at a telemedical service centre

## Patients’ Work
Patients had to perform technical and procedural tasks: attaching electrodes, recording ECGs, transmitting data by phone, and maintaining devices

This required procedural/practical knowledge and selective strategies to integrate into daily routines

## Invisible Work of Nurses
Nurses played crucial roles in *teaching* patients, *troubleshooting*, and *ensuring* competence

Their instructional and supportive role often hidden in narratives of “self-care.”

## Invisible Work of Physicians at Telemedical Centres
Provided real-time *technical guidance*, *reassurance*, and *affective support*.

Phone interactions built trust and intimacy at a distance, especially for anxious or elderly patients

## Discussion & Conclusion
Patients’ ability to act as diagnostic agents depends not only on motivation but on socio-technical networks (devices, nurses, physicians).

Invisible work includes articulation, affective, and inclusion work.

Extends study of “invisible work” beyond occupational contexts to patients’ everyday lives

# Embodied Action, Enacted Bodies: The Example of Hypoglycaemia (Annemarie Mol & John Law, 2004)

## Introduction
Traditional dichotomy: body as object (medical gaze) vs. body as subject (self-awareness).

Proposal: add the “body-we-do” – bodies enacted in daily practices.

Draws from ethnographic stories of people living with diabetes

## Conceptual Framework
Foucault: body-object/subject distinction emerged in 19th-century medicine

Authors move beyond knowledge-centered perspectives: focus on practices and enactments.

> **Enactment**: an instance of acting something out.

Ethnography as method: stories reveal how bodies are “done” in everyday life

## Case Study: Hypoglycaemia
Textbook definition: a measurable blood glucose level (<3.5 mmol/l) = “body-we-have.”

Lived experience: hypoglycaemia as an event in daily life = “body-we-do.”

Ethnography attends to how people sense, anticipate, and act around low blood sugar

## Practices of Living with Diabetes
**Preparation**: Patients carry food, dextrose, insulin everywhere (body extends into surroundings)

**Sensing & Acting**: Measuring blood sugar, recognizing symptoms, eating to recover.

**Relational Bodies**: Partners, colleagues intervene (e.g., injecting glucagon during comas) – bodies are porous and enacted collectively

## Theoretical Insights
The “body-we-do” is neither whole nor fragmented but a configuration full of tensions (control vs. erratic events, medical demands vs. everyday life)

Medicine is not just about knowledge but interventions in lived bodies and lives.

Ethnographic storytelling should inform medicine’s self-reflection

## Discussion & Conclusion
Medicine should see itself as enacting bodies through practices, not merely diagnosing objects.

Suggests an “ethnographic turn” in medical self-reflection, telling jagged, practice-oriented stories instead of smooth epidemiological accounts

Implication: understanding embodiment requires recognizing multiplicity, tensions, and relational enactments.
