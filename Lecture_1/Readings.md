# The Anthropology of Technology: The Formation of a Field

## Technology and Techniques

**Technologies** are understood as **artefacts**. This foregrounds their material existence, origin, creation, and use.
To this day, technologies are often disembedded from the social and from human bodies, as they come to ‘stand out’ materially.
This is because there are still too few narrative repertoires that allow for
the weaving together of technology and social relations into integrated wholes,
since it would require us to abandon modernity’s divide between technology
and society

**Anthropologists** and **archaeologists** have always shared an interest in the most
mundane and taken-for-granted things of everyday life,


>Anthropologists have provided several useful definitions of technology:
>*  *If we are to understand technologies, we must go beyond the
artefacts and include human bodies, skills, traditions, practices, processes, and
socio-technical systems when conceptualising them.*

### Distinctions between ‘technique’ and ‘technology’
These distinctions can be partially understood through the way the terms ‘technique’ and ‘technology’ are used in French and English.

#### French term
François Sigaut discusses the terms systematically and defines **techniques** (the preferred term in French anthropology) by referring to Marcel Mauss’s proposition: 
>*‘We call techniques an ensemble of movements or actions, in general and for the most part manual, which are organized and traditional, and which work together towards the achievement of a goal known to be physical or chemical or organic’*

#### English term
Here, the concept of technology usually refers to the achievements of modern engineering,
>*‘in short, those techniques that are informed by a relatively scientific content. and methods’*


# In short 

## Core Concepts of Anthropology of Technology

### 1. Technology as Social Phenomenon

* Not just material culture but a total social phenomenon (Mauss).
* Involves material, social, and symbolic associations.
* Anthropologists study artefacts, skills, practices, systems, and meanings.

### 2. Techniques vs. Technology
>French tradition: techniques = bodily/mundane actions (Mauss, Lemonnier).

>Anglo-American: technology = modern, complex systems (Pfaffenberger, Ingold).

>Mauss: “The body is man’s first and most natural instrument.”

>Lemonnier: Techniques involve matter, energy, objects, gestures, knowledge.

### 3. Key Thinkers and Approaches

**Mauss**: Techniques of the body; collective, learned practices.

**Leroi-Gourhan**: Operational sequence (chaîne opératoire); links body + tools.

**Ingold**: Skills, making, ecological approach; focus on improvisation & dexterity.

**Pfaffenberger**: Socio-technical systems; tech as cultural + political + symbolic.

**Escobar**: Technology as an agent in cultural production; focus on Global South.

**Gell**: “Technologies of enchantment”—magic, art, persuasion.

**Haraway**: Feminist critique; “situated knowledges,” partial perspectives.

## Historical Shifts
### 1. 19th Century Evolutionism
Morgan: technology as marker of civilisation stages (savage → barbarian → civilised).

Used in racist/colonial hierarchies (Pitt Rivers museum displays).

Critiques: Firmin (anti-racist anthropology), Boas (cultural relativism), Rivers (diffusion).

### 2. From Artefacts to Processes
Malinowski: canoe-building in Kula exchange = more than technical; linked to magic, exchange, belief.

Shift to studying *systems* not just objects.

Marxist/cultural materialist approaches (White, Steward, Godelier, Sahlins, Harris) → link tech with production, ecology, power.

### 3. Late 20th Century
1980s–1990s revival: seminars, science and technology studies STS collaborations, feminist and postcolonial critiques.

Lemonnier: “technological choices” → societies adopt some methods, reject others.

Downey & Dumit: “Cyborgs & Citadels” → hi-tech ethnographies.

Escobar: hybrid cultures, selective adoption of modern tech.

Haraway: feminist technoscience, situated knowledge.

### 4. 21st Century Developments
Interdisciplinary collaborations with STS, computer science, medicine.

New ethnographic sites: algorithms, datafication, biomedicine, hacking.

Global Assemblages (Ong & Collier): citizenship, biopolitics, infrastructure.

Postcolonial & Indigenous critiques: sciences from below, decolonising technology.

## Thematic Contributions

**Knowledge Practices** – Skills, traditions, techniques in tech use.

**Communities & Collectives** – How groups form around tech (users, experts, activists).

**Ethics & Values** – Moral implications of reproductive tech, AI, surveillance.

**Infrastructures & Inequalities** – Tech embedded in political economies; shapes power and access.

## For memorisation
* **Mauss** = body as first tool.
* **Lemonnier** = 5 elements of techniques.
* **Ingold** = making & skills.
* **Pfaffenberger** = socio-technical systems.
* **Escobar** = tech as cultural agent, Global South focus.
* **Gell** = enchantment & magic.
* **Haraway** = feminist, situated knowledges.
